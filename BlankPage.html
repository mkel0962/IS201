        I love thinking through things in an organized, analytical way, but I also love having more than one right answer and way to do things. I also like other aspects of many of the business programs here at BYU, but Marketing stands out to me the most. Because of this, I am currently pursuing a Marketing Degree at BYU.

            When I initially became interested in Marketing, I was really attracted to the Market Research side of things. I have always loved research and seeing how factual information can support what we observe. As a market researcher, I would collect information about people and especially their views on current marketing initiatives. The graph below shows an example of data that market researchers have collected about Social Media Influencers.

        This semester, however, I participated in an On-Campus Internship for Safe Space Counseling where we boosted their online social media presence. We created Instagram and TikTok accounts, updated their website, and hosted events for them. I really enjoyed this internship and working with my team, especially in the social media aspect. It was really fun to look at other therapist pages that were doing really well and to model our posts after them, which helped our posts to gain more traction than they would otherwise. This experience helped me realize that Social Media Marketing would be something I would be good at and passionate about. Below is a picture of my internship team at our last team meeting.

        As I've been considering marketing as a career path, I have watched different YouTube videos of people in the marketing field, especially those involved in Social Media. Below is a video of a social media manager where she explains what she does every day for work.
